What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a ".git" folder. It is needed to store future commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area acts as an intermediary between the working directory and the repository to prevent any perminent changes from being commited. It also provides greater control  over commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	By using "git diff", you can easily check to see if your changes follow a logical flow. This command checks between the working area and the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	Branches are helpful with making larger changes that you otherwise wouldn't make in the master branch; usually experimental changes. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Like a tree, the diagrams show the transition between commits, and how they influence eachother.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	
	Only code that is mutually added/changed between commits is merged into the master branch. Anything else is disgarded or left alone. You represent it in that way to demonstrate how the tip of the master branch is affected by the deleted "coins" branch.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	The pros are seamless integration, and the easiness of reverting back to a previous version. The cons are the potential human interaction that may need to take place to discuss possible revisions.
